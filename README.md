1. [main.r](main.r)

## History

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29>

R was created in 1993 together with all other open source scripting languages of the world, the Cambrian explosion of such species.

But R is actually based on S, which was made in... Bell Labs in 1978. Bell Labs does like one letter programming languages!
